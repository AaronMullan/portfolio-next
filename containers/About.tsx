            <span className="text-red mr-2 text-7xl">Hello, World!</span> I'm a
            Full Stack Software Developer with a Product focus. Before
            transitioning to coding in 2019 I built a career as an Audio
            Engineer. Touring with rock bands sharpened my ability to
            collaborate under pressure, solve problems creatively, and navigate
            big personalitiesâ€”skills that now serve me well in software
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I bring the same passion for craftsmanship and teamwork to coding;
            pairing relentless curiosity with strong communication to translate
            stakeholder visions into technically excellent, user-focused
            products. As a Developer, I work closely with the business and
            design teams to scope projects and select technologies. In a
            leadership role I establish code patterns, plan development sprints,
            and assign tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            At it's best, creating software or music exists where I thrive: at
            the intersection of learning and collaboration; where I can dive
            deep into technologies, then work with people knowledgeable in other
            areas to create something greater than the sum of its parts.
