          <strong className="text-red">Problem:</strong> A Denver-based PR
          agency wanted to monetize its role as a matchmaker between clients and
          service providers (photographers, videographers, etc.). The goal was
          to build a curated marketplace where clients could find, hire,
          communicate with, and pay providersâ€”all within a single platform that
          takes a fee.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong className="text-blue">Solution:</strong> Collaborating with
          the business and design teams, we built a Next.js app using the shadcn
          component library, with Strapi as the backend. We integrated Clerk for
          authentication, Stripe for payments, Mailchimp for transactional
          emails, Algolia for search, and Stream for chat.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong className="text-green">Result:</strong> The client received a
          polished, fully functional freelancer marketplace, now being populated
          with Denver-area creatives.
